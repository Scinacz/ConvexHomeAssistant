# ConvexHomeAssistant
Your Own Home Assistant!

Unfourtuneatly i could not provide the source code as a github repository for some strange reasons
so i will put it in the releases as a zip named SRC

The python script is a pc standalone of Convex, the arduino ofc has all the animation frames and
and has a reciver that changes the animations when Convex is talking.
